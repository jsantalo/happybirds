Comments from class 01/02/2018:
	We can use the labels to obtain more suitable vocabulary, maybe neutral comments are misleading.
	We need to do crossvalidation at some point
	The order of words can change sentiment
	For next class (17/04/2018) we have to upload to kaggle results with a most suited model
	We will need to use feature selection [we will see it in next classes]
	Naive Bayes only considers if the word is in the text, it does not consider number of appearences
	At the end of the project (03/07/2018), we will need to present a news repport talking about some airline companies
